# pytti-docker

Port of PYTTI notebook geared towards local execution. Integrated with ClearML for job logging, monitoring, and comparison. 

Contributions welcome.

## Requirements

* docker
* ClearML 
  - either a local instance (requires docker-compose) or create a free account on the hosted service
  - Will change this to not be a requirement soon.
  - Also planning to add support for WandB, etc. 

## Setup

1. Clone and CD into this project
2. Add your `clearml.conf` to the root directory
3. Build the container

    $ docker build -t pytti:test .
    
  This automates installing packages for PYTTI and downloading pre-trained models.

4. Start the container

    $ mkdir /opt/colab/images_out
    $ docker run --rm -it -p 8181:8181 --gpus all -v /opt/colab/images_out:/opt/colab/images_out pytti:test
    
  You should know have a jupyter server running at http://localhost:8181/lab?token=UniqueNewYork . (You should change that token for security)

## Usage

You should now be able to run the pytti beta-p5 notebook. 

Additionally, the container contains a modified version of the notebook code which can be run as a script. This script is configured with OmegaConf/Hydra yaml files. To use this script:

1. Define a new experiment by adding a config file to the ./config/conf directory. You only need to specify anything you want changed from the defaults, which are specified in ./config/default.yaml . Let's say you named your experiment configuration: ./config/conf/demo.yaml

2. Open a terminal on the jupyter server
3. Run the script, passing the experiment defining config as an argument for hydra.

    python pytti_cli_w_clearml.py conf=demo
    
  Because the config is managed by hydra, you can override experiment parameters by specifspecified them on the command line.
